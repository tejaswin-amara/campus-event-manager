# CampusConnect project structure

> **Purpose:** Map repository paths to runtime responsibility, verification evidence, and contributor entry points.
> **Current baseline:** Java 25, Spring Boot 4.1.0, MySQL 8.4, Flyway V1–V3

CampusConnect is organized as a **layered modular monolith**. Spring component scanning, Thymeleaf view resolution, Flyway migration discovery, and CI conventions mean that a file can be required even when it has no direct caller in another Java class.

| `User.java` | Authentication identity, role, and password state |
| `Event.java` | Event metadata, dates, venue, capacity, external link, and database-backed media fields |

| `UserRepository.java` | User lookup and pessimistic initialization queries |
| `EventRepository.java` | Event filtering, pagination, upcoming-event queries, and locking queries |

### Security and exception handling

| --- | --- |
| `RateLimitingFilter.java` | Caffeine-backed Bucket4j login throttling |
| `SecurityAuditLogger.java` | Structured security-relevant logging without raw PII or secrets |
| `PiiUtils.java` | Stable hashing/obfuscation helpers for audit fields |
| `EventNotFoundException.java` | Domain exception for missing events |
| `InvalidImageException.java` | Domain exception for invalid image content |
| `GlobalExceptionHandler.java` | Consistent user-safe handling of validation, not-found, upload, authorization, and unexpected errors |

## Resources

### Configuration and operations

| Path | Responsibility |
| --- | --- |
| `src/main/resources/application.properties` | Default environment-variable-driven configuration, Flyway plus `flyway-mysql`, JPA validation, session, uploads, resilience, logging, and Actuator settings |
| `src/main/resources/application-prod.properties` | Stricter production profile with HTTPS cookies, MySQL TLS, no database creation, and hidden health details |
| `src/main/resources/logback-spring.xml` | Console and structured Logstash logging configuration |

### Database migrations

| File | Responsibility |
| --- | --- |
| `V1__Initial_Schema.sql` | Baseline users, events, registrations, keys, and initial constraints |
| `V2__Add_Image_Blob_Columns.sql` | Database-backed image data and MIME metadata |
| `V3__Add_event_query_indexes_and_integrity_checks.sql` | Query-aware indexes, event date checks, status constraints, and integrity hardening |

Flyway migration filenames are part of the database contract. Do not rename or delete an applied migration; add a new version instead.

### Thymeleaf templates

| Template | Responsibility |
| --- | --- |
| `dashboard.html` | Student-facing event catalogue and recommendations |
| `event_detail.html` | Event details, image, external registration link, and interest action |
| `admin_login.html` | Admin login form |
| `admin_dashboard.html` | Admin event management, analytics, filtering, and export controls |
| `error.html` | User-safe error fallback |

### Static assets

| Path | Responsibility |
| --- | --- |
| `static/css/style.css` | Visual system, responsive layout, glassmorphism surfaces, and accessibility-conscious states |
| `static/js/main.js` | Catalogue interactions, search/filter behavior, and progressive enhancement |
| `static/js/dashboard.js` | Dashboard-specific behavior and recommendation interactions |
| `static/js/admin-dashboard.js` | Admin dashboard interactions and visualization behavior |
| `static/images/logo.png` | Application brand asset |
| `static/favicon.svg` | Browser favicon |
| `static/manifest.json`, `static/sw.js` | PWA metadata and service-worker behavior; preserve only when the corresponding install/offline experience is supported |

## Tests

The repository contains **63 automated tests** across unit, model, controller, security, service, and integration-oriented classes.

| Test class | Evidence area |
| --- | --- |
| `AppConfigTest`, `DataInitializerTest` | Configuration and safe bootstrap |
| `AdminControllerIntegrationTest`, `AdminControllerSecurityTest` | Admin workflows and authorization |
| `AuthControllerTest`, `SessionFixationTest` | Authentication and session security |
| `EventControllerTest` | Public event routes and request behavior |
| `GlobalExceptionHandlerTest` | User-safe error mapping |
| `EventTest`, `RecommendedEventTest` | Domain/model invariants and DTO behavior |
| `RateLimitingFilterTest`, `SecurityAuditLoggerTest` | Abuse controls and structured audit behavior |
| `EventServiceTest`, `RecommendationServiceTest`, `SessionServiceTest`, `UserServiceTest` | Core application services and recommendation logic |

Run the complete suite with `./mvnw -B verify`. Runtime-backed tests require the documented MySQL configuration; the CI and Compose verification path uses MySQL 8.4.

## CI and documentation evidence

| Path | Responsibility |
| --- | --- |
| `.github/workflows/ci.yml` | Java 25 build, MySQL 8.4 service, tests, coverage, dependency review, and image checks |
| `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/` | Reproducible bug and feature intake |
| `.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md` | Review, test, security, and documentation checklist |
| `scripts/smoke-test.sh` | Health/OpenAPI runtime smoke checks |
| `scripts/load-test.sh` | Repeatable lightweight concurrency sanity check |
| `docs/` | Requirements, C4 architecture, data, API, services, operations, security, testing, compliance, showcase, cleanup audit, version record, and reference provenance |

## Cleanup boundary

The Ponytail cleanup audit is documented in [`docs/cleanup-audit.md`](docs/cleanup-audit.md). The cleanup removed stale remediation notes, a machine-specific CodeRabbit rule, optional Windows wrappers, local editor settings, orphaned screenshots, an obsolete standalone QA plan, and the unused Spring Boot DevTools dependency. Runtime dependencies, migrations, tests, CI, security controls, and application assets remain because they have documented behavior or handout-evidence value.
