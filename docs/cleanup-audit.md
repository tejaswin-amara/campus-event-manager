# Ponytail cleanup audit

> **Scope:** Complete CampusConnect repository and remote GitHub tree
> **Audit mode:** Whole-repository over-engineering review
> **Important boundary:** This report is advisory; correctness, security, and performance review remain separate validation passes.

## Executive conclusion

CampusConnect is already a relatively small Spring Boot website. The audit found **a limited amount of safe cleanup**, not a justification for a broad rewrite. The largest confirmed issue is documentation drift in the legacy remediation folder. The Maven dependency-analysis report also emitted broad “unused declared dependency” warnings, but those warnings are not reliable for Spring Boot starters, annotation-driven auto-configuration, Actuator, Flyway, Thymeleaf, test slices, or runtime JDBC drivers; no dependency is removed on that basis alone.

> **Ponytail result:** Remove stale duplicate remediation notes, preserve runtime and DBSE&DBD evidence, and defer ambiguous developer conveniences until a project-owner policy is established.

## Baseline evidence

| Check | Result |
| --- | --- |
| Baseline commit | `ada6689` previous Ponytail cleanup commit |
| Tracked files | Full Java application, templates, static assets, migrations, tests, CI, Docker/Compose, scripts, and documentation present |
| Test command | `./mvnw -B test` executed |
| Test result | 63 tests discovered; 28 application-context errors because the local environment supplied no MySQL credentials and Flyway attempted `ubuntu@localhost` with no password |
| Passing test groups | Unit-oriented configuration, rate limiting, event service, recommendation service, session service, user service, and model tests passed |
| Environment limitation | Runtime-backed tests require MySQL configuration; this is not a cleanup regression |
| Ignored output | `target/` is generated and ignored; it is not part of the proposed GitHub cleanup |
| Ponytail source | Official `ponytail-audit` instructions were reviewed; the workflow explicitly produces findings and applies no fixes |

## Candidate register

| Tag | Candidate | Evidence | Disposition | Reason |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `delete` | `docs/remediation/completion_report.md` | Claims Spring Boot 3.4.2-era state, includes stale “enterprise-grade” language, and duplicates current security, operations, testing, and showcase documents | **REMOVE** | Superseded by current documentation and contains inaccurate version/verification claims |
| `delete` | `docs/remediation/remediation_roadmap.md` | References old dependency versions and unfinished tasks that are now either implemented or represented elsewhere | **REMOVE** | Historical working notes are not authoritative evidence; current docs preserve the final controls and remaining gaps |
| `delete` | `docs/remediation/security_design.md` | Contains machine-local `file:///d:/...` links and a proposal-only README plan | **REMOVE** | Obsolete planning note with no unique security evidence |
| `delete` | `run_app.ps1`, `stop_app.ps1` | Only referenced by the project-structure guide; Docker Compose is the canonical local path and the scripts add no runtime or CI capability | **REMOVE** | Optional platform-specific wrappers are unnecessary for the website and duplicated the documented Maven/Compose workflow |
| `delete` | `.vscode/settings.json` | Contains only local Java editor settings and no build, CI, or runtime configuration | **REMOVE** | Editor preferences do not belong in the application repository when the build already provides the Maven Wrapper |
| `delete` | `.agents/rules/coderabbit-pro-autofix.md` | Contains a local Windows/WSL path, obsolete “13 comments/74 files” context, and an instruction to invoke a non-repository CLI | **REMOVE** | Stale machine-specific automation rule; it is not a reliable repository governance control |
| `native` | Maven dependencies | `dependency:analyze` reports starters as unused because usage is annotation/configuration/auto-configuration driven | **KEEP** | Removing them would break runtime or tests; verify by application context and package-level usage instead |
| `delete` | `target/` | Build output is ignored by `.gitignore` and absent from `git ls-files` | **KEEP-IGNORED** | No GitHub deletion required; clean locally when needed |
| `delete` | `images/hero.png`, `images/student_view.png` | No active README or documentation link and no runtime consumer; runtime branding lives under `src/main/resources/static/images/` | **REMOVE** | Orphaned repository-level screenshots add size without contributing to the current website or evidence package |
| `delete` | `docs/StudentDashboard_QA_TestPlan.md` | Standalone plan describes behavior not present in the current UI, including modal/QR/ICS flows, and duplicates the maintained testing/showcase guides | **REMOVE** | Stale manual test plan is not executable evidence and contains obsolete product claims |

## Framework reachability checks

The following categories were explicitly treated as reachable even when textual reference counts are low:

| Category | Why it is protected |
| --- | --- |
| `@Configuration`, `@Service`, `@Controller`, `@Repository` classes | Spring component scanning discovers them at runtime |
| Thymeleaf templates and static assets | View names and browser URLs resolve them indirectly |
| Flyway migrations | Versioned filenames are discovered by Flyway and are part of database history |
| `application*.properties` keys | Spring binding and auto-configuration consume them without direct Java references |
| CI workflows and shell scripts | They are external operational entry points and handout evidence |
| Security and test classes | They encode controls and verification even when not part of the production call graph |

## Adopted cleanup principles

The audit adopts the following practices from the supplied references without introducing their unrelated runtime stacks:

1. **Ponytail:** rank cuts by evidence and favor deletion over speculative abstraction, but keep the audit one-shot and separate from correctness/security review. [1]
2. **Agent governance:** apply least privilege, explicit policy, clean execution boundaries, and auditable decisions to automation and CI guidance. [2]
3. **Code intelligence:** use reference-aware search and framework reachability checks before declaring a symbol dead. [3]
4. **No-mistakes Git:** require clean-tree checks, expected diff inspection, validation before push, and no history rewrite. [4]
5. **UI/UX review:** keep screenshots and visual assets only when they improve product comprehension, accessibility review, or evaluator evidence. [5] [6]
6. **Rust/ImGui/open-design boundaries:** retain a focused Java website rather than adding native, desktop, or alternate-language infrastructure without a concrete requirement. [7] [8] [9]

## Planned implementation

The second pass removed the three stale remediation notes and machine-specific CodeRabbit rule from the first commit, then removed the optional PowerShell wrappers, local editor settings, orphaned screenshots, stale standalone QA plan, and unused Spring Boot DevTools dependency. Migrations, tests, CI, security controls, runtime assets, and all behavior-bearing dependencies remain.
