# CampusConnect documentation

> **Documentation status:** Maintained for the current `main` branch
> **Last verified against:** Commit `39d5e6a`
> **Audience:** Developers, reviewers, release operators, security reviewers, and DBSE&DBD evaluators

This directory is the authoritative evidence package for CampusConnect. It distinguishes **implemented behavior** from **documented evolution**, records the cleanup decisions that shaped the repository, and provides reproducible commands for build, test, operations, and demonstration.

## Current implementation vocabulary

| Term | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| **Implemented** | Present in source and represented by tests, CI, or runtime evidence |
| **Production-oriented** | Safe for controlled deployment after environment-specific secrets, TLS, durable storage, backups, monitoring ownership, and release approval are configured |
| **External registration** | The configured event URL remains authoritative; the local `registrations` table records interest and analytics |
| **Documented evolution** | A future boundary or technology option that is not a deployed runtime component |
| **Derived recommendation** | A non-persistent view computed by `RecommendationService` from relational event and interest data |

## Verification commands

```bash
# Complete build, test, migration, package, and JaCoCo verification
./mvnw -B verify

# Runtime checks after starting the application
BASE_URL=http://localhost:9090 ./scripts/smoke-test.sh
REQUESTS=100 CONCURRENCY=10 BASE_URL=http://localhost:9090 ./scripts/load-test.sh
```

The canonical CI and Compose path uses **Java 25 and MySQL 8.4**. Flyway 12 requires the MySQL database support module, which is declared as `org.flywaydb:flyway-mysql` alongside Spring Boot’s `spring-boot-starter-flyway`. A local sandbox with MySQL 8.0 or without credentials may not reproduce the runtime-backed test path; do not weaken production validation to accommodate it.

## Current CI evidence

The latest repair commit, `39d5e6a`, passed GitHub Actions build, test, coverage, container-build, and dependency-review workflow handling. The CI job provisions MySQL 8.4, configures the application with test-only credentials, runs `./mvnw -B verify`, uploads JaCoCo output, and builds the container without pushing it.
