## Security Measures

This project implements the following security measures:

- BCrypt password hashing (strength 12) with timing attack mitigation
- CSRF protection on all state-changing operations
- Rate limiting on login endpoints (Bucket4j)
- Session fixation prevention
- Strict production cookie policies (`HttpOnly`, `Secure`, `SameSite=Strict`); local development may set `COOKIE_SECURE=false` for plain HTTP
- File upload validation (MIME check, extension whitelist, UUID filenames)
- Pessimistic locking for concurrent data access
