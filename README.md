## 🎯 Project Overview

**CampusConnect** is more than just an event listing site; it's a sophisticated university middleware designed with a **mobile-first** philosophy. Developed to bridge the communication gap between student organizations and university administrations, the platform leverages cutting-edge web design (glassmorphism, micro-animations) and enterprise-grade backend stability to provide a "handheld-first" campus experience.

## ✨ Features

### 🧑‍🎓 For Students
- **Glassmorphism UI**: A premium, translucent interface inspired by modern design trends.
- **Micro-Animations**: Fluid transitions and interactive elements for enhanced engagement.
- **Dynamic QR Integration**: Automatic registration QR codes for instant event enrollment.
- **Calendar Synchronization**: Export events directly to Google/Outlook with one click.
- **Smart Filtering**: Categorize events by *Technical*, *Cultural*, *Sports*, *Workshop*, and more.

### 👨‍💼 For Administrators
- **Interactive Analytics**: Real-time data visualization via `Chart.js` for engagement tracking.
- **Lifecycle Management**: Secure creation, modification, and automated cleanup of event assets.
- **Data Export**: One-click CSV export of university-wide event statistics.
- **Health Monitoring**: Real-time server resource tracking (CPU, Memory) directly in the panel.

## 🏗️ Technical Architecture

The application follows a clean, hexagonal-lite architecture with clearly defined boundaries for logic, security, and persistence.

### 🛡️ Security Hardening (Zero-Trust)
Our 2026 security audit implemented a comprehensive Zero-Trust model:
- **Authentication**: Atomic BCrypt hashing with constant-time comparison to negate side-channel attacks.
- **Session Protection**: Hardened CSRF tokens and strict `SameSite=Strict`, `HttpOnly`, `Secure` cookie policies.
- **Concurrency Control**: Pessimistic Write Locking (`PESSIMISTIC_WRITE`) on critical registration paths to prevent race conditions.
- **Resource Protection**: Symbolic link validation and UUID-based filename sanitization for all uploads.

### ⚡ Architecture Resilience
- **Resilience4j Implementation**: All external registration redirects are wrapped in a **Circuit Breaker**.
- **Flyway Migrations**: Transactional database schema management ensuring consistency across environments.
- **Observability**: Structured MDC-based logging with Logstash encoder for auditability.
